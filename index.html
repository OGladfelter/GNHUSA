				<p>What makes a policy effective? Politicians often look at metrics like jobs created or economic impact, but GNHUSA wants to think about government programs differently. We ask: how effective are different government programs at increasing the happiness of citizens?</p>
				<p>GNHUSA commissioned a survey from market research company Prodege, recruiting 5,000 US residents and asking them a series of standardized questions on their happiness and wellbeing. The sample was evenly split across each of the 50 states, with each state collecting 100 responses stratified by age and gender.<sup id="footnote1">1</sup><span class="footnote" id="footnote1Text">Because we sampled evenly across states, our universe overrepresents lower-populated states, like Wyoming and Alaska.</span></p>

				<h2>South Carolina Boasts Highest Life Satisfaction,<br>Arkansas Reports Lowest Average</h2>
				<p>With residents from every state participating in the survey, we are able to locate the peaks and valleys of happiness across the US - as inconspicuous as they may be.</p>
				<div>

						<p>Respondents from <span id="top0">South Carolina</span>, <span id="top1">Kentucky</span>, <span id="top2">Delaware</span>, <span id="top3">New Jersey</span>, and <span id="top4">Maryland</span> reported the highest life satisfaction.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="scrollOnTop">
						<p>South Carolina, Kentucky, Delaware, and New Jersey are the only states to exceed an average life satisfaction score of 7.0 on a 10-point scale. Maryland falls just short, with an average score of 6.9.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="scrollOnTop" id="bottom5LifeSatStep">
						<p>Respondents from <span id="bottom0">Arkansas</span>, <span id="bottom1">Rhode Island</span>, <span id="bottom2">Oregon</span>, <span id="bottom3">Oklahoma</span>, and <span id="bottom4">Washington</span> reported the lowest life satisfaction.</p>

						<p>These five states each score 6.0 or just slightly below on a 10-point scale.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="scrollOnTop" id="finalMapStep">
						<p>In the grand scheme of things, we do not find major discrepancies in life satisfaction among the 50 states. Residents from no single state are profoundly more satisfied with their lives than those in other regions; likewise, no single state falls behind the rest of the country in this metric. In fact, all but 7 US states have an average life satisfaction between 6.0 and 6.9. The gap between South Carolina and Arkansas' scores is minor compared to that found between high- and low-scoring countries in the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/happiness-benevolence-and-trust-during-covid-19-and-beyond/#measuring-and-explaining-national-differences-in-life-evaluations" target="_blank">World Happiness Report</a>.</p>

				<h2>What's the 21st letter of the alphabet got to do with happiness? Not much at the moment.</h2>
				<p>One of the most fascinating ideas in the study of wellbeing is called the <i>U-Shaped Happiness Curve</i>. It's the shape you get when you survey people’s happiness on a 1-10 scale and plot the results by age of survey respondent. The U-shape implies that the average person enters young adulthood with relatively high happiness levels and gradually becomes less happy with each passing year before bottoming out in midlife, at which point happiness rebounds to reach its zenith in old age.</p>
				<div class="miniChartContainer">
					<p style="display:inline-block; width:70%; position:relative; top:0;">As such, the relationship between age and life satisfaction normally would look something like:</p>
					<div style="display:inline-block; width:29%;" id="miniChart"></div>
				</div>
				<p>While it may seem counterintuitive that people tend to begin and end adult life with the highest relative happiness levels, this trend in lifetime happiness has been observed with shocking frequency. One ambitious <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-020-00797-z" target="_blank">study</a> published in 2020 showed this U-shaped curve can be found in 145 countries!</p>
				<p>In this case, however, younger respondents on average report the lowest life satisfaction.</p>
				<div id="ageAndHappinessScatterplot"></div>
				<div id="tooltip0" class="tooltip"></div>
				<p>After analyzing the data gathered during GNHUSA’s US Happiness Survey, we were unable to replicate the storied U-shape. In this case, it's apparent that younger adults in the US are experiencing and reporting lower happiness levels which produces a linear trend rather than the expected U-shape. Our findings contradict expectations from the 'U-shaped' literature but are corroborated by a recent Harvard <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2795626#:~:text=The%20maximum%20difference%20in%20overall,%2C%207.00%20%5B1.50%5D)%2C%20and" target="_blank">study</a> which also shows lower levels of happiness for young adults. In fact, the study found that young adults were the least happy of all adult age cohorts surveyed, leading the study's authors to hypothesize that the decline is evidence of a mental health crisis and increase in loneliness in the US that has disproportionately affected young adults. We think this hypothesis seems plausible given the COVID-19 pandemic, climate and technology anxiety, and the absence of a widely adopted sustainable approach to measuring economic wellbeing in the US.</p>

				<h2>Above all else, Americans credit family with their happiness</h2>

						<h3>USA Happiness Domains<span id="hiddenTitle" class="insideHeader" style="opacity:0;">: <span class="insideHeader" style="color:#38a3f5;"><45</span> and <span class="insideHeader" style="color:#0024d9;">45+</span></span></h3>

				</div>
				<div class="lollipopTextContainer">
					<p class="bottom-space lollipopText">The GNHUSA survey's sole open-ended question  simply asked "What makes you happy?" Although the answers to this question were sweeping in nature, some themes were mentioned at a significantly high rate.</p>
					<p class="bottom-space lollipopText" id="family">For example, <b>family</b> was mentioned in 45 percent of responses, making it by far the most common factor to which respondents attributed their happiness.<sup id="footnote2">2</sup><span class="footnote" id="footnote2Text">This includes any submission which used at least one of the following keywords: family, husband, wife, daughter, son, granddaughter, grandson, grandchildren, 'my children.'</span></p>
					<p class="bottom-space lollipopText" id="religion">Other common topics such as <b>health</b>, <b>finances</b>, and <b>religion</b> were touched on in 6.3, 6.2, and 4.5 percent of responses, respectively.<sup id="footnote3">3</sup><span class="footnote" id="footnote3Text">A submission was counted as answering "health" if it used any of the following keywords: health, healthy, exercise, exercising, working out, gym, being active, hiking, biking;<br><br>counted as answering "finances" if it used: money, financially, finances, debt, bills, or economy;<br><br>and counted as "religion" if it used: god, lord, church, prayer, bible, jesus, faith, christian, temple, or religion.</span></p>
					<p class="bottom-space lollipopText" id="ageGaps">Perhaps unsurprisingly, respondents aged 45 years and older were more likley to think of family, health, and religion than respondents younger than 45. For example, 48% of respondents 45 and older mentioned family in their answer, a significant increase from the 41% of respondents less than 45 who did the same. Age gaps were present among all the other domains of happiness as well, but to a lesser degree.</p>
					<p class="lollipopText">Finance was the only domain of happiness where younger respondents were more likely to mention it in their answer. Notably, respondents who touched on financials in their answers - making money, paying bills, debt, the economy, etc - reported lower levels of happiness and higher levels of anxiety than those who did not think to write about financials in their answers.</p>
