<p><a href="https://gnhusa.org/" target="_blank">Gross National Happiness USA</a> strives to encourage local and state governments to measure and track happiness and other wellbeing metrics.</p>
<p>In the absence of nation-wide happiness measurement, we commisioned a 5,000 respondent survey to help fill the gap. Data collected through this survey was analyzed and visualized in the <a href="https://cultureplot.com/usa-happiness-report" target="_blank">GNHUSA Happiness Report</a>.</p> 
<p>This repository stores the code behind the report.</p>
